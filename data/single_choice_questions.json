        "options": [
            "Pre-defined tags",
            "Concerned with carrying data",

        ],
        "answer": ["Concerned with carrying data"],
        "explanation": "XML is a format that includes predefined tags for structuring and representing data. It is primarily used for carrying and structuring data, including but not limited to data interchange and storage.<br><br>While XML is not limited to displaying data, it can be used for this purpose as well but HTML is better suited for that purpose.<br><br>Unlike JSON and YAML, XML does not use key:value pairs as its primary syntax."
